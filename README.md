# Transport-Simulation-Core

This project abstracts all station, route, depot, vehicle code, etc. to a separate project, allowing for better performance when used in a game. This is designed to be used with [Minecraft Transit Railway](https://github.com/jonafanho/Minecraft-Transit-Railway). The code is very much work in progress, so don't report issues or fork the code yet!
